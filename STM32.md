# Introduction #

RT-Thread/STM32 is a branches for STM32F series microcontrollers of STMicroelectronics. The STM32F series of 32-bit Flash microcontrollers is based on the breakthrough ARM Cortexâ„¢-M3 core - a core specifically developed for embedded applications. The features of RT-Thread/STM32 include:
  * RT-Thread Kernel, 10K ROM and 2K RAM usage on STM32;
  * FinSH shell in USART1 or USART2;
  * Device File System, built-in SPI and SDIO interface driver;
  * LwIP, built-in enc28j60, dm9000a and STM32F107 Ethernet interface driver. 5K RAM usage on STM32;
  * RT-GUI
  * Development Tools, GNU GCC(scons as build tool), Keil MDK, IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM.
